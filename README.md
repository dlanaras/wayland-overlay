### This is pretty much a fork of https://github.com/VerdeQuar/wayland-picture-in-picture with some small modifications and an extra script for starting and stopping

### In this version you don't have to press "Enter" for the overlay to not be interactable, its instead so by default.

### The toggle script does two things
#### 1. Checks if the php webserver and python main.py processes are running
#### 2. Kills them if thats the case or starts them if not

## Motivation behind this
### Really liked the gnome extensions that makes it snow on your screen (https://github.com/ExposedCat/snowy) but couldn't use it, because im on sway.
### Came across the wayland-picture-in-picture repository

## If you want to use this you need to add a gif with the name snowing.gif inside the main directory 
### (You can do way more than just use this with a transparent gif but this is my use case for this)
